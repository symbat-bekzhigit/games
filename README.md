# Games

Here are some games that I created as a part of the coursework for the Intro to CS class.
All the games, except for the Air hockey, were written entirely by me. The Air hockey game was a group project written in collaboration with one of my groupmates.

Programming language used: Python

Concepts covered: fundamental programming concepts such as looping, searching, sorting, recursion, etc. and various advanced concepts such as object-oriented programming and graphical user interface.
