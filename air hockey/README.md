# Air Hockey game

This a computer modification of the table Air Hockey game. As in the real-life game, in the computer version of Air Hockey there will be two players who will attempt to score points by using a paddle to shoot a disk into the opponent's goal.
This game is created in collaboration with one of my friends Aibar Talip as a final project for one of the CS classes that I took in my freshman year.

**Game Specifities**

- Player must bounce the ball in the opponent’s goal in order to score points
- Each player will have a paddle and an individual score counter
- Players can move the paddle only vertically (along the initially specified y-axis)
- The players will be able to restart the game once the game is over
- The control key for the player 1 will be “W” and “S” keys, for the player 2 - “UP” and
“DOWN” keys
- When colliding with a paddle, disk will bounce with the same speed as before in the
opposite direction (conservation of impulse)
- Disk will also bounce off with the same angle (angle of incidence = angle of reflection)
