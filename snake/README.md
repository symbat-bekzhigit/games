# Snake game

This is a simultaion of the video game "Snake" where the player maneuvers a growing snake that becomes a primary obstacle to itself.
The player controls the snake by moving it up/down/right/left on a bordered plane. The snake grows as it eats the fruits (apple and banana) that appear in turn in random places on the plane.

**Game specifities**

- Initially, the snake will have a head, with eyes pointing in the direction that the snake moves, and a small body consisting of green circles.
- As the snake grows by eating fruits appearing randomly on a board, a circle will be attached to the end of the snake's body. The color of the circle attached will depend on the fruit that the snake eats: banana will result in yellow circle and apple will result in red circle.
- The speed with which the snake will move on a board is constant.
- There is a conuter for the score that increments every time the snake successfully eats the fruit.
- The player loses when the snake runs into the screen border or itself.
