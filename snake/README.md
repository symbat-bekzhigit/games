# Snake game

This is an online simulation of a two-player connection board game where the players take turns dropping their tokens into the 8x8 vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens.
